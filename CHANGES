Release history for lariza

v16.12  2016-12-24
  [Fixed]
  - Lariza no longer reports download progress below 0% or above 100%.
    (Workaround for what appears to be a WebKit2GTK+ bug.)

  [Changed]
  - We no longer explicitly set the X11 window's class and name. Let
    GTK+ do this job. The actual class and name should be unchanged,
    though (WM_CLASS(STRING) = "lariza", "Lariza").

    This does not affect tabbed which is still run with "-n lariza".

    This change fixes a GTK+ deprecation warning.

v16.09  2016-09-03
  [Changed]
  - Web extensions are now looked for in ~/.config/lariza/web_extensions.

v16.06  2016-06-26
  [Fixed]
  - Gtk warnings.

  [Changed]
  - Except for the default window size, there are no hardcoded pixel
    values anymore. Should make it a little easier to run lariza on
    HiDPI screens. (Sorry, not tested, I don't have one.)

  [Added]
  - New key bindings F2 and F3: Go backward and forward, just like the
    existing mouse key binds do.

v16.01  2016-01-05
  [Fixed]
  - Issue #14: "Keypad enter" now registers as "commit", i.e. "start
    loading the URL" or "begin searching for search term".
  - Issue #15: lariza no longer tries to create local file names with
    directory separators in them when downloading files.
  - lariza no longer sets the window title to an empty string.

  [Changed]
  - For the sake of consistency, $LARIZA_WEB_EXTENSIONS_DIR has been
    removed.

  [Added]
  - Manpages are now available.

v15.09 and earlier releases
  - Sorry, the CHANGES file did not exist back then. Please refer to the
    Git log.
